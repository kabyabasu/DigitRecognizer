# Developing Handwritten Digit recognizer 

The code majorly has 3 part in it.


1. Data download and training the model:

In the "Instructions_model_Training&Saving.html" we have downloaded the MNIST data set and trained the image data set with a
convolution neural network in a tensorflow and keras framework.

2. Saving the model:

With the help of export_model function, we save the trained model and later use this saved model to predict handwritten digit in mobile.


3. Developing Android App:

I took up the Android developer basic course offered by udacity to develop this app, the instructor Kunal and Kathrin was awesome in this.

The app actually does only two jobs (A) You have a canvas in the app where you can draw a digit and when you hit on the detect button, it will predict the digit that has been drawn.

I have included everything DigitRecognizer_APP
